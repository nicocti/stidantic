# To enable deterministic IDs for STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs), each SCO defines a set of one or more properties named "ID Contributing Properties". These properties MAY be used in the default calculation of the id when creating a SCO. In some cases, additional selection of extension properties that contribute to the ID may be described in the ID Contributing Properties section listed on each SCO. The default algorithm that creates the SCO ID based on those named properties is a UUIDv5 as defined in Section 2.9, however, other algorithms for creating the SCO ID MAY be used.
# Deterministic IDs (UUIDv5) in the example SCOs contained in this specification were computed using the algorithm defined in section 2.9. Every attempt was made for these IDs to be accurate. Certain IDs which were used in reference properties of the examples did not include the actual object, and therefore it was impossible to accurately compute the appropriate UUIDv5. In these cases, a UUIDv4 was generated.
